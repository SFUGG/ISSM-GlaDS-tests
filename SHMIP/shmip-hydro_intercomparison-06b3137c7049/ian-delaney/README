This is a simple 1D subglacial hydrology model implementing the linked
cavity + R-channel equations, aka conduits (Kessler & Anderson 2004,
Schoof 2010). Here, it is used in SHMIP.

I created this for the "Subglacial processes workshop at Centre for
Ice and Climate, The Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen
7-11th April 2014".

See my website for more course materials:

Tested with Matlab R2013a and Octave 3.8.1.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
To begin a session, initialize with the startup.m script, then cd in to the 'model' directory.

The script, 'runner.m', is set to run all suites of the SHMIP series. 
However, for some runs (i.e. B1) changes to tolerances or storage capacity (sigma)
might be required for the model to run properly.
Also the workspace is saved in the form .mat to a directory, '../results', from this present directory.

Axuillary files, now only for moulin inputs, is included in this directory.

A script, save_netcdf, is included. 0nce again this script is set to be run once all .mat files are creates.
