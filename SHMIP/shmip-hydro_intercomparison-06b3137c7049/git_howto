Basic workflow
==============

Before making changes, pull (if you remember/can) to get the latest
and greatest from the bitbucket reprository:

$ git pull

Make your changes.  If you make new files include them with

$ git add new_file

Check what's on with

$ git status

If you're happy with what you've done commit it into your local repository

$ git commit -am 'some descriptive text of changes here'

To get it to bitbucket do:

First pull the latest from gitbucket (if only one person is working at
the time this will do nothing but it's good practice)

$ git pull

If it says that there are merge conflicts resolve them (this is beyond
the scop of this howto see http://progit.org/book/ch3-2.html, ignore
the first section and scroll down to 'Basic Merge Conflicts')

The push your changes to bitbucket:

$ git push

What to do if you have local changes you don't want to commit
-------------------------------------------------------------

Say you made some change to your local copy but don't want to commit
them.  But if you try to pull from bitbucket it will give an error.
Do:

$ git stash
$ git pull
$ git stash pop
